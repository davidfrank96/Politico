          <h3>VOTE</h3>
          <p>
            In a democracy, a government is chosen by voting in an election: a
            way for an electorate to elect, i.e. choose, among several
            candidates for rule. In a representative democracy voting is the
            method by the which the electorate appoints its representatives in
            its government.
